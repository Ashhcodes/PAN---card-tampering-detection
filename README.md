# PAN---card-tampering-detection
This repository contains a small production-ready Flask web app for PAN card tamper detection. The app accepts uploaded PAN card images and runs a tamper-detection model and returns a prediction (tampered / genuine), a confidence score, and an optional visualization showing regions of concern.
